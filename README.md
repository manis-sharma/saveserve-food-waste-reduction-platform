# 🌱 SaveServe — Food Waste Reduction Platform

SaveServe is a modern, scalable web platform designed to **reduce food waste responsibly** by connecting restaurants with surplus cooked food to nearby individuals and NGOs — while strictly maintaining **food safety, transparency, and regulatory awareness**.

This project combines **software engineering**, **food safety principles**, and **social impact** to address one of the most critical sustainability challenges faced by the food industry today.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Every day, restaurants prepare excess cooked food to meet unpredictable demand.  
When this food is not sold in time, it is discarded — even if it is still safe to consume.

This leads to:
- Massive food waste
- Economic losses for restaurants
- Environmental damage
- Missed opportunities to support communities and NGOs

**SaveServe transforms surplus food into shared value — safely and responsibly.**

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

SaveServe provides a **regulated digital platform** where:
- Restaurants can list surplus cooked food
- Individuals and NGOs can discover nearby food
- Time-based automation ensures food safety
- All actions are logged for transparency and compliance

The platform supports **public access before login** and **role-based dashboards after login**, ensuring both accessibility and accountability.

## 🌍 Before Login (Public Access)

No login is required to explore available surplus food.

### Public Features:
- Live food availability dashboard
